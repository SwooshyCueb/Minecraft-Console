I'm slowly but surely porting this to Forge. No builds yet. Old builds can be found [here](https://github.com/simo415/Minecraft-Console).

Features 
--------

 - Very customisable
 - Works in all Single and Multi player game modes
 - Dynamic window resizing
 - No text overflow
 - Keeps history of whole Minecraft session, not just per world
 - Key bindings
 - Word completion with server spesific list, including player names
    - @<username> also works, ex @ar will match to any playername that starts with "ar" like @arbiter
    - WorldEdit commands for world completion is supported.
    - Most normal commands is also supported.
    - Custom words as well.
